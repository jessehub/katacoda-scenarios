 <h4> Yesterday </h4>
  <p> The weather yesterday 2/13 was not great. If you don't remember it then I suppose you can think of it as being pleasantly sunny with a mild breeze of up to 5mph just enough to move 2 or 3 hairs, but not enough to make you have to spend $20 at the salon for new gel. In reality though it was like -17&deg;C and raining . The wind was 35mph and the effect was to create a sheet of ice on one side of your body if you were stupid enough to walk outside on a day like it was.
  <h4> Today </h4>
  <p> It's just terrible outside today. Honestly, just look out the window. It's quite nice. A full 180 turnaround from yesterday's assault of nature against nature. We're thinking the highs are 72&deg;F and the lows are hardly even low at all.. more like mids the whole day. There is 0 UV today, due to a strange refractive effect going on. Don't ask why. If you have 20 questions we have 0 answers.
 <h4> Tomorry </h4>
  <p> It's gonna be hotter than a 2 dollar pistol
